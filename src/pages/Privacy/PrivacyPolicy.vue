        <HeaderSmall>1. Personal information we collect</HeaderSmall>
        <p>We collect personal information in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You provide the information to inputs on the website</li>
          <li>
            When you sign into the website using Riot Sign On ("RSO"), or from other third parties
            (See 1.1)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <HeaderSmall>1.1 Data provided by third-parties</HeaderSmall>
        <p>
          When you sign in to the website using RSO, Riot Games provides the website with
          information about your account, such as your username and email.
        </p>
        <HeaderSmall>1.2 Data we collect</HeaderSmall>
        <p>
          When you sign in to the website, we keep a record of your Riot account identifier and an
          email contact. We also use information from your VALORANT account, including your matches,
          for use in VCT Tools apps ("Apps").
        </p>
        <HeaderSmall>2. Data we disclose</HeaderSmall>
        <p>
          We will never disclose your personal information to the public, however, data such as
          VALORANT matches will be able to be seen by others through apps if you accept the policy.
        </p>
        <HeaderSmall>2.1 Data requests</HeaderSmall>
        <p>
          We will return you a copy of all personal information we have collected if you wish to
          view it.
        </p>
        <HeaderSmall>3. Security Measures</HeaderSmall>
        <p>
          Your data requires your authorization to access. Your data is secured in transit using the
          HTTPS protocol, and sensitive information is hashed or encrypted.
        </p>
        <HeaderSmall>4. Data Retention</HeaderSmall>
        <p>
          User data is kept for the duration of your VCT Tools account (created when you log in with
          RSO) lifetime. If you request an account deletion from the website, your data will be
          deleted alongside your account, immediately.
        </p>
        <HeaderSmall>5. User Rights</HeaderSmall>

        <p>
          To delete collected data, you are required to delete your VCT Tools account (See Data
          Retention).
        </p>
        <HeaderSmall>5.2 Opt Out</HeaderSmall>
        <p>
          We only collect data that is completely necessary for the website to function, and it is
          not possible to opt out of data collection.
        </p>
        <HeaderSmall>6. Updates</HeaderSmall>
